# Maui Eldorado J102

Aloha and e komo mai _(welcome)_ to our beautiful condo.

My husband and I fell in love with the location of the unit. Private setting, so close to
the beach, and all right smack in the middle of Ka'anapali Trail. We hope you enjoy it as much as we do.

We bought the place February 2020 and have completed a HUGE remodel, including new
kitchen, bathrooms and sliding glass doors. You won't recognize the pre-renovation photos
once its done!

We are excited and commited to providing you a wonderful experience. Please read
more about your upcoming stay below, and don't hesitate to reach out with any questions. We hope
you have a wonderful stay!
