# Maui Eldorado J102

Aloha and e komo mai _(welcome)_ to our beautiful condo. We are excited to host you!  We just completed a huge remodel and are excited to welcome our first guests!

We are committed to providing you a wonderful experience and hope you enjoy the place as much as my husband and I do. We
love the location, its private setting so close to
the beach, and still right in the middle of Ka'anapali Trail.

This is a guide for you with more information about your stay at the condo, so please explore, and don't hesitate to reach out with any questions. We hope
you have a wonderful stay!
