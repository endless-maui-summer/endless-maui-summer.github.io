## Front desk and bell services

## Pools
* There are 3 pools at the property (a map will be provided to you at check in)
* No towels provided at the pool, so bring from the cabana or the towels provided at the unit.

## Cabana
The cabana is a wonderful amenity complete with stove, fridge, seating, bathroom, and beach towel and chair service. Call the front desk for a ride there and/or back.

## Beach Equipment
The beach equipment is located in the box on the lanai, and will include a couple of boogie boards and snorkel sets in addition to an assortment of small toys. Please store the items as they were after each use.

## Beach Chairs
There are 4 beach chairs provided for your use.  Please remember to check your trunk for any beach chairs (and towels) that may have been left in there. There should be 4 at the beginning of your stay and 4 at the end.
> __Staying at our beach?__ Then save yourself the pain of lugging the equipment as the beach cabana provides beach chairs and towels for day use.

## Beach Towels
* There are 8 beach towels in the condo for your use. Please make sure to bring them back each day. There is a $75 fee for each lost towel as they are special light weight towels for your convenience.
* These towels belong to this unit and can not be exchanged at the front desk.
    > The beach cabana also provides beach towels and beach chairs. This is my preferred way to have a clean towel everyday without the hassle of drying and cleaning them.

## Ka'anapali' Trolley
* There's a stop right outside the Sheraton which is within view from the lanai.

## Televisions
* The television service provider is Spectrum
  * https://www.tvchannellists.com/List_of_channels_on_Spectrum_(Maui,_Hawaii)
* There are also apps built into the TV for common services streaming services
* Don't forget to logout from your accounts before you leave.

## Activities
There is plenty to do on Maui no matter what your tastes are. Golf, tennis, snorkeling, whale watching, day trips to Hana or the volcano. Unfortunately, we are not the most well versed in the details of all of these. We recommend you peruse the travel blogs and activity booking sites for ideas.

Perhaps our favorite activities snorkeling at Black Rock and Airport Beach, both just a short walk from the unit.

A couple of popular experiences you might want to look into:
* Catching the sunrise at HaleakalƒÅ (the volcano)
* The Road to Hana, the lush, curvy ride to the east of the island where Black Sands beach and waterfalls await. Checkout the Shaka app on your phone for a guided tour as you drive.
* Snorkeling in Honolua Bay
* Whale watching/sunset cruise, with boats departing from Whaler's Village

## Bird watching
* There is an amazing plethora of birds to admire from the lanai. Please avoid the temptation to feed the birds. It avoids the mess birds inevitably make.

## Board games
There are a variety of board and card games available in the TV stand.
