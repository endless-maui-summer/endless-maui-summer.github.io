## Showers
* We are the closest to the beach, but also at the end of the water line, so the water can take a couple of minutes to warm up.
> You may want to run the water a bit before hopping in but please close the door/curtain behind you to avoid water pooling on the bathroom floor

## Beds and bedding
* There will be an extra pillow, blanket, and extra set of sheets in the bottom drawers of the large dressers in each room and bin located in the queens bedroom.

## Queen sleeper
* The queen sleeper sofa bed will not be made up prior to check in.
* If you plan to use it, please let me know in advance so that I can have the housekeeper leave out the bin with queen sleeper materials.
* There will be clean mattress pad, linens, pillows, and blanket for the sleeper.

## Garbage and Recycling
* There are communal trash containers down the hall out the front door.
* Should you wish to separate your recyclables, there is a recycling center at the very end of the hallway past the nearest garbage containers.

## Kitchen Housewares and Materials at the unit
* This unit is personally owned and therefore all of the items are personal and belong to this specific unit, not part of timeshare or large management company.
> Please be sure that the items that leave the unit, come back to our unit as we have no way of retrieving items left at other units.

## Cleaning supplies
There are everyday cleaning supplies under the kitchen sink should you need to address any small messes.

> If a spill should happen on the couch or chairs, please blot it up with a towel. Then take a damp cloth and some Folex (you will find under the kitchen sink) and get it up.

## Baby Items
We provide a high chair, baby tub and a pack and play style bed. You will find all of the items in the queen bedroom closet.

## Coasters
You will find drink coasters placed throughout the condo for your use. The drinks really sweat on the islands, and the coasters will keep the furniture looking new for years to come.

## Air Conditioning
* There are air conditioning units in each bedroom and the living room.

> Please note that the A/C won't work when the sliding glass doors are open for that room.

## Ceiling Fans
* There's one in each room. The power is controlled at the switch, so if the fan is not responding, try flipping the fan switch. Then use the remote control. Please return the remote control to the wall mount to avoid misplacing it.
