* Please wash sand off thoroughly at the beach cabana and the foot wash to avoid sand in the shower drain and laundry machines.
* Please don't move the furniture, especially the dining table. It is very heavy and difficult to move back.
* Please don't bring the outdoor furniture inside. They do not have the appropriate protection to avoid scratching the floor.
* Please don't sit with wet clothes or bathing suits on the interior furniture. Exterior furniture is water resistant, so no worries there!
* Keep the bugs out, close the screen doors behind you.
* Please no smoking, which is explicitly prohibited on the property.

> We hope that's not too much! Its mainly to keep the place nice for future guests, of which we hope you will be after your stay!
