## Repairs or Issues
* If anything comes up, please [contact us](/contacts) so that we can the address the issue immediately. For small repairs of immediate concern, you may also call the [front desk](/contacts) for assistance.

> Please note theres a plunger underneath the sink in the queens bedroom, in the unlikely event you need it ðŸ’©

## Sand, sand, every where
* Although its inevitable to track some of it home with you from the beach, please do your best to clean off at the showers provided for you at the cabana, as well as the foot wash just around the corner from the front door.
* This helps keep the shower drains clear and helps prevent building plumbing issues.
* Sand is particularly harmful for the dryer, so please make sure to shake out the beach towels and wash out any excess sand from your swim wear before laundering them.

## Shower Drains
* The cleaners thoroughly clean the drains after every guest, but build up of sand and hair can happen. If you notice the water start to pool, please remove the drain cap and remove any build up to fix the flow.

## Bugs
* Its Hawaii and those unwelcome house guests are unavoidable. We recommend always closing the screens behind you, especially at night!

## Damage
* While I hope nothing happens during your stay, __accidents do happen__. If you would please report it to me when it happens _(not waiting until check out)_ so I can get it resolved as soon as possible.
> Depending on what it is, it could take a few days to arrange repair or replacement, as things typically move at island's pace ðŸŒ´.

## That could be better?
* Should you see something that needs my attention, please let me know. We take great pride in making sure that the unit is in the best condition possible for you.
* Since we are not there daily, I have to count on my fabulous housekeeper and wonderful guests to let me know that something is missing, in disrepair, or in need of attention.
> Unless otherwise noted to you before your check in everything at the unit should be in working order, __so let me know if you find otherwise__.
